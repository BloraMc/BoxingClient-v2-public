# BoxingClient v2

BoxingClient v2 is succesor to the original BoxingClient, a "ghost client" for Minecraft 1.8.9. It is a basic client for Minecraft 1.8.9 with modules to help with gameplay.

**Some modules may be banned on some servers, use at your own risk.**
**I do not condone cheating on Minecraft and this is just an experimental project.**

The code is really bad and was quickly done. The modules that work work well, some modules don't work, it's just really bad.
Some features such as **ISP, Aim Assist, and AutoClicker** work great! As of 09/02/2026, those work on some anticheats (Polar, GrimAC, AGC).
The code is not public, however the code is really bad and **not obfuscated**, you can just decompile it if you wanted to. You can download the client but I **do not recommend using it on public servers!!!**

The buggy modules got removed from the code before getting posted on the public repo.
